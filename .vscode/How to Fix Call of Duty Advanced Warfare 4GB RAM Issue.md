## How to Improve Your Gaming Performance with 4GB RAM
 
Even if you manage to run Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare with 4GB of RAM, you might still experience some lagging or stuttering during the gameplay. This is because the game is very demanding and requires a lot of resources from your PC. To improve your gaming performance and reduce the lag, you can try some of these tips:

- Lower the graphics settings in the game options. You can adjust the resolution, texture quality, shadow quality, anti-aliasing, and other settings to find the best balance between quality and performance.
- Close any unnecessary programs or background processes that are running on your PC. You can use the Task Manager to see which programs are using the most CPU, memory, or disk resources and end them.
- Update your drivers for your graphics card, sound card, and other hardware components. You can use a program like Driver Booster or Driver Easy to scan your PC and download the latest drivers automatically.
- Defragment your hard drive or use a SSD instead. A fragmented hard drive can slow down your PC and affect your gaming performance. You can use a program like Defraggler or Smart Defrag to defragment your hard drive and optimize it for faster access. Alternatively, you can upgrade to a SSD (solid state drive), which is much faster and more reliable than a HDD (hard disk drive).
- Upgrade your RAM or use a RAM optimizer. If none of the above tips work for you, you might want to consider upgrading your RAM to at least 8GB or more. This will allow you to run the game and other programs more smoothly and without any errors. However, if you don't want to spend money on new hardware, you can also use a RAM optimizer program like Razer Cortex or Wise Memory Optimizer to free up some RAM and boost your gaming performance.

By following these tips, you should be able to enjoy Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare with 4GB of RAM and without any major issues. However, keep in mind that these are not guaranteed solutions and they might not work for everyone. The best way to ensure a smooth and optimal gaming experience is to meet the minimum or recommended system requirements for the game.
